# Basic-CRUD-PHP-MySQL
while waiting for the holiday to end, I learned new things, that is learning a web programming language for the back end (PHP) and learning SQL syntax. In practice, I also use bootstrap for a fresher appearance and Jquery to make the web more interactive. Here is a web view running on localhost.
